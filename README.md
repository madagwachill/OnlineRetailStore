# OnlineRetailStore
Online Retail Store Sales Analysis.
In this project, I use Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of Sales store data broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

I started by cleaning the data. This tasks include:

    Drop NaN values from DataFrame
    Removing rows based on a condition
    Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

After cleaning the data, I answered the following business questions using exploratory data analysis:
Show a graph of Total Sales made By Country
    Total Number of Product ordered by Countries?
    What city sold the most product?
    What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
    What products are most often sold together?
    What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

    Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
    Adding columns
    Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
    Using the .apply() method
    Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
    Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
    Labeling our graphs
